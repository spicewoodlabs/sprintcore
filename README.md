### Step 1: Index your codebase/git repo. 
This is a one time step unless you add moee code. Run the following command from the root directory to index your repo. Pass the source code repo in the `--source` parameter. Make sure to not index `node_modules` or other directories. Provide the full path and not the relative path

#### NextJS

`$ sprintcore index-code --lang nextjs --source-code /Users/myuser/code-examples/tsx/ [--index INDEX]`

#### Javascript

`$ sprintcore index-code --lang js --source-code /Users/myuser/code-examples/tsx/ [--index INDEX]`

## Step 2: Query the index (Optional)
Query the index to find top k matching documents 


`$ sprintcore bug-fix --bug_description "post title is not appearing on the page" --mode query`


### Step 3: Get code fix recommendations from AI


`$ sprintcore bug-fix  --bug_description "post title is not appearing on the page" --mode fix_code`
